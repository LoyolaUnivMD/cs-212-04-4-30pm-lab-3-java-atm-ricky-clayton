introduce program
Assign value for user's current balance as 212.90 (double)
Assign value for proceed as true (used for while loop to control ATM menu) (boolean)
Assign value for total amount deposited as 0 (printed when user selects "leave") (double)
Assign value for total amount withdrawn as 0 (printed when user selects "leave") (double)

Ask user for their name (string)
Welcome user to the ATM

while proceed = true
    Ask user to Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, or Leave (string)
    Modify selection input to be lower case

    if user selects deposit
        ask user for deposit amount (double)
        while deposit value <= 0
            inform the user to enter a value greater than 0
            ask for deposit amount again
        call deposit method with arguments current balance and deposit value to update the amount in account
        update total amount deposited by adding to it the deposit value
        print new balance after deposit

    else if user selects withdraw
        ask user for withdraw amount (double)
        while withdraw value <= 0 (check for negative or $0.00 withdraw)
            inform user to deposit at least $0.01
            ask for withdraw value again
        while withdraw value > current balance (check for overdraw)
            inform user of insufficient funds
            ask for withdraw amount again
        call withdraw method with arguments current balance and withdraw value to update amount in account
        print new balance after withdraw

    else if user selects check balance
        print current balance

    else if user selects leave
        ask user if they want a printed or emailed receipt (string)
        modify receipt type input to be lower case
        while user does not enter "p" and "e" for receipt type input
            inform user of invalid selection
            ask for receipt input again
            modify receipt input to be lowercase
        if user selects a printed receipt
            print "Remember to take your receipt."
        else if user selects an emailed receipt
            print "Your receipt will be emailed to the email address associated with your account."
        print total amount withdrawn
        print total amount deposited
        print thank you message
        assign proceed as leave method to end while loop and end program
    else
        ask user to input a valid menu option
